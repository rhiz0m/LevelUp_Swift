ðŸ•¹ Dog years

   Create a struct called person, with a storied property of type Int called age, and then add a computed property called ageInDogYears of type Int that returns the age of the person in dog years (age * 7).
 */




/*
ðŸ•¹ isEquilateral

    Given the following Triangle stucture, write a computed property that determines whether the sides of the triangle are equilateral (all three sides are equal).

    var isEquilateral: Bool {
        return ?
    }

/*
ðŸ•¹ Title in the Post

 Add a property observer stored property title that trims white space and new lines when the title stored property is set.

 > struct Post
 > var title: String
 > title.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)

 */



/*
ðŸ•¹ Observe the radius

    Define a class of type Circle. Give it a stored property `radius` of type `Double`.
    And use the `didSet` property observer to ensure no negative values get assigned to radius.
    If negative number, assign radius value of 0.

 */



/*
ðŸ•¹ Compute the area

 Building on the previous example, calculate the circles area as a computed property.

 Hint: area = radius * radius * Double.pi

 */



/*
ðŸ•¹ Set the radius via the square root.

    Building on previous question, add a setter to the computed property area. When the area is set, have it set the stored property radius.
