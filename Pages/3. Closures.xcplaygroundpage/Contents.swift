/*
ðŸ•¹ K times

Write a function named applyKTimes that takes an integer K and a closure and calls the closure K times. The closure will not take any parameters and will not have a return value.

> applyKTimes(K: 3, closure: { print("I heart Swift") })

*/


/*

ðŸ•¹ Div3

Use filter to create an array called multiples that contains all the multiples of 3 from a given array.

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 3, 12, 11]

> let multiples = numbers.filter { ? }                     // Hint: Modulus Operator

// [3, 6, 9, 3, 12]

*/



/*
ðŸ•¹ Max

Find the largest number from numbers and then print it. Use reduce to solve this exercise.

*/



/*

ðŸ•¹ Join

Join all the strings from strings into one using reduce. Add spaces in between strings. Print your result.

> var strings = ["We", "Heart", "Swift"]
> "We Heart Swift"

*/


/*

ðŸ•¹ Chains

Find the sum of the squares of all the odd numbers from numbers and then print it. Use map, filter and reduce to solve this problem.

> var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
> 25 // 1 + 9 + 25 -> 25

*/



/*

ðŸ•¹ For each

Implement a function forEach(array: [Int], _ closure: Int -> ()) that takes an array of integers and a closure and runs the closure for each element of the array.

var array = [1,2,3,4]
forEach(array) {
    print($0 + 1)
}
// This will be printed:
// 2
// 3
// 4

*/



/*
ðŸ•¹ Bonus: Combine arrays

Implement a function combineArrays that takes 2 arrays and a closure that combines 2 Ints into a single Int. The function combines the two arrays into a single array using the provided closure. Assume that the 2 arrays have equal length.

> var array1 = [1,2,3,4]
> var array2 = [5,5,5,3]

combineArrays(array1,array2) {
    $0 * $1
}

> [5,10,15,12]
