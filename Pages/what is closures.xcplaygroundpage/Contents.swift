// Closures have type

// a closure that has no parameters and return a String
var hello: () -> (String) = {
    return "Hello!"
}

hello() // Hello!

// but you don't need to include
var hello2 = {
    return "Hello!"
}

hello() // Hello!

// a closure that take one Int and return an Int
var double: (Int) -> (Int) = { x in
    return 2 * x
}

double(2) // 4

// you can pass closures in your code, for example to other variables
var alsoDouble = double

alsoDouble(3) // 6

// Closures are first class citizens in Swift (variables, functions, return types).
// - asynchronous network calls
// - as a means of passing around processing
// - also make our code easier to read and reason about

// Example - Array has a method called sort that takes a function (as a closure) and uses it to compare elements.

/// func sorted(by areInIncreasingOrder: (Element, Element) -> Bool) -> [Element]

// Instead of trying to come up with every permutation and combination of how users would want to compare,
// it defines a closure, as a type, and let's you write whatever comparison logic you want yourself.

/// func sorted(Element, Element) -> Bool) -> [Element]
/// func backward(String, String) -> Bool ->  [String]

let names = ["Chris", "Alex", "Ewa", "Barry", "Daniella"]

// We can define a function matching that signature...
func backward(_ s1: String, _ s2: String) -> Bool {
    return s1 > s2 // define our logic (as a closure)
}

// and then pass that in and use it to sort the names in our array
let reversedNames1 = names.sorted(by: backward)

// Swift has lots of shortcuts for how to write closures more tersely (matter of style and choice).

// Closure inlined
let reversedNames2 = names.sorted(by: { (s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in
    return s1 > s2
})

// Inferring type from context
let reversedNames3 = names.sorted(by: { s1, s2 in return s1 > s2 } )

// Implicit return from single-expression
let reversedNames4 = names.sorted(by: { s1, s2 in s1 > s2 } )

// Shorthand $0 $1
let reversedNames5 = names.sorted(by: { $0 > $1 } )

// Trailing closure
let reversedNames7 = names.sorted() { $0 > $1 }

// Operator methods that match our function signature
let reversedNames6 = names.sorted(by: >)

// - Ready Player 1 ðŸ•¹ ShortFirst
