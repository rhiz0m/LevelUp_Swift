ðŸ•¹ Grid Warrior
 
 You are a game designer in which your character is exploring a grid like map. You get the original location of the character and the steps he/she will take.
 
 Write the code, that will:
  - increment y + 1 if up
  - decrement y - 1 if down
  - increment x + 1 if right
  - decrement x - 1 if left
 
 Print the final location after all the steps have been taken
